## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former movie rental giant, aims to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive in the era of streaming services. As a data analyst in the Business Intelligence (BI) department, your role involves loading data into a relational database and using SQL to analyze and provide data-driven insights for the company's 2020 strategy.

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board seeks answers to critical questions, such as identifying top and bottom revenue-generating movies, determining average rental duration, understanding customer locations, and evaluating sales variations across geographic regions. 

1.  Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2.  What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3.  Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4.  Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5.  Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Context
Using SQL, I've thoroughly answered these questions and visualized the results for effective communication with Rockbuster management via MS Excel and Tableau. This project offers hands-on experience in SQL, applicable across industries.

## Data and Tools
The project utilizes a 3MB data set containing information about Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, and payments. Establishing relationships between tables, I've loaded this data into a PostgreSQL database to perform query-based analyses.
